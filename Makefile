# Makefile for impresso language identification
#
# Read the README.md for more information on how to use this Makefile.
# Or run `make` for online help.

#### ENABLE LOGGING FIRST
# USER-VARIABLE: LOGGING_LEVEL
# Defines the logging level for the Makefile.

# Load our make logging functions
include cookbook/log.mk


# USER-VARIABLE: CONFIG_LOCAL_MAKE
# Defines the name of the local configuration file to include.
#
# This file is used to override default settings and provide local configuration. If a
# file with this name exists in the current directory, it will be included. If the file
# does not exist, it will be silently ignored. Never add the file called config.local.mk
# to the repository! If you have stored config files in the repository set the
# CONFIG_LOCAL_MAKE variable to a different name.
CONFIG_LOCAL_MAKE ?= config.local.mk

# Load local config if it exists (ignore silently if it does not exists)
-include $(CONFIG_LOCAL_MAKE)


# Now we can use the logging function to show the current logging level
  $(call log.info, LOGGING_LEVEL)


#: Show help message
